# MPC Controller for Trajectory Following

In this project an MPC ("model predictive control") controller is used to calculate steering inputs for a virtual vehicle driving on a simulated test track.
This controller uses optimization over the space of possible future movements to guide the vehicle along a reference path (= center of the road).

For a detailed write-up of the project please see write_up.pdf.
