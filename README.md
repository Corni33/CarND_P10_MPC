# MPC Controller for Path Following

In this project, an MPC ("Model Predictive Control") controller is used to calculate steering and gas/brake pedal inputs for a virtual vehicle driving on a simulated test track. This MPC controller uses optimization over the space of possible future movements to guide the vehicle along a reference path (= center of the road).

For a detailed summary of the project please see [this write-up](https://github.com/Corni33/CarND_P10_MPC/blob/master/write_up.pdf).
